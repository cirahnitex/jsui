<p>We are going to develop a software to highlight the user’s interests when browsing the internet.</p>

<p>We decided to build this software using HTML and Javascript. The reason is quite simple. Since the project is “for the web”, we would like to make it “by the web”.</p>

<div class="page-header"><h1>
    <small>Stage 1:</small> Basic Skeleton
</h1></div>
<p>user can browse the web via our software</p>
<p>our software can record user’s action.(mouseover, click)</p>
<p>our software can manipulate this web page</p>

<div class="page-header"><h1>
    <small>Stage 2:</small> Obtaining Hints
</h1></div>

<p>define a hotkey for user to “add to interests” and “remove from interests”</p>
<p>identify the exact element that the user want to “add” or “remove”</p>
<p>store all the sample elements that user submits</p>

<div class="page-header"><h1>
    <small>Stage 3:</small> Creating Selectors
</h1></div>

<p>for each web page, analyze the positive sample elements and negative sample elements that user submits, figure out a Selector to locate the user’s interests in this web page..</p>
<p>store these Selectors for later use</p>

<div class="page-header"><h1>
    <small>Stage 4:</small> Grouping up web pages
</h1></div>

<p>for web pages that share similar or identical selectors, find their common Features.</p>
<p>store these Features for later use</p>

<div class="page-header"><h1>
    <small>Stage 5:</small> Applying all that we’ve got
</h1></div>

<p>create a “smart browsing mode”</p>
<p>when user is browsing the web in smart browsing mode, check the Features for current web page, and apply corresponding Selectors. Highlight the elements that our Selector selects.</p>
